@section('first') Thank you for applying to HackIT. 
Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you an invitation to HackIT.
Every year, weâ€™re given the opportunity to learn about the thousands of students
 who apply to HackIT, and it is never easy to narrow down such a diverse and passionate group
  of individuals. With that being said, our decision is not a negative assessment of your skills
   or accomplishments, nor does it reflect your ability to build something incredible.
@endsection
 
@section('second')Thanks for your interest in HackIT .
 We encourage you to keep learning and building incredible things in your community.
